=======================
mumble-django changelog
=======================

Version 0.5, 18 April 2009:
------------------------------
* Added redirect for / into urls.py, as this is easier than configuring
  it in the Apache config because it doesn't require the user to do
  anything.
* Completely refurbished the user interface, now using a YAML template
  and ExtJS for some extra cool stuff. Still, the page does not _require_
  JavaScript to be enabled in order to function correctly, users with JS
  disabled will only see the registration forms and a hint to enable JS.

Version 0.4, 10 April 2009:
------------------------------
* Various bug fixes.
* Added settings for django-registration to settings.py, so users can
  actually find them and don't need to figure these out on their own.
* Added a form for Server Admins (people added to the Admin group on the
  root channel) to change a few settings like server password and MOTD.

Version 0.3, 25 March 2009:
------------------------------
* added basepath autodetection.
* added "Admin on root channel" field that allows editing the ACL of the
  root channel, to grant or revoke membership in the "admins" group,
  thereby granting/revoking Administrator privileges.

Version 0.2, 24 March 2009:
------------------------------

* Reorganized settings.py, so only one single line needs to be edited in
  order to configure everything.
* Added a syncdb hook that looks for already configured Murmur instances
  whenever syncdb is run, and writes found instances and users into the
  database.
* Various minor bug fixes.

Version 0.1, 21 February 2009:
------------------------------

* Set up a Django project that uses the Mumble application to make use
  easier for Django inexperienced users
* First official Release
