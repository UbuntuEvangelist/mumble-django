Thanks for downloading mumble-django.

To install the fully functional version, extract it to wherever you would
like it to reside. Alter settings.py to fit your needs (the most important
parts are the Database config and the TEMPLATE_DIRS), and then run:

    python manage.py syncdb

If you need instructions on how to configure your web server in order to
serve this application, you can have a look at the Wiki at
<http://bitbucket.org/Svedrin/mumble-django/wiki/Webserver_Setup>. The wsgi
config file is already included as mumble-django.wsgi, but you will have to
alter the paths in this file.

Note that there is no need to use the same Database that Murmur itself uses,
as mumble-django exclusively uses DBus to connect to Murmur and does not
access Murmur's database directly.

Also note that this application requires Python 2.3 or later, and a
functional installation of Django 1.0 or newer. You can obtain Python
from http://www.python.org/ and Django from http://www.djangoproject.com/.
