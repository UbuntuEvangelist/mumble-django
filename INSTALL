Thanks for downloading mumble-django.

To install mumble-django, extract it to wherever you would like it to
reside, and then run:

    python manage.py syncdb

Under most circumstances, that should be all you need to do. However, if
Murmur is not configured to connect to DBus, syncdb will give you an error
message and Mumble-Django will not be able to work correctly. In this case,
have a look at the wiki at
<http://bitbucket.org/Svedrin/mumble-django/wiki/Connecting_Murmur_to_DBus>
for instructions how to connect Murmur to DBus.

If you need instructions on how to configure your web server in order to
serve this application, you can have a look at the Wiki at
<http://bitbucket.org/Svedrin/mumble-django/wiki/Webserver_Setup>. The wsgi
script is also able to detect the installation paths automatically, so you
shouldn't need to edit it.

Django_Registration requires a valid EMail address to be set in settings.py,
that can be used as a sender address for the registration emails. If you
intend to use the registration feature, you may need to change the
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL setting in settings.py.

Note that there is no need to use the same Database that Murmur itself uses,
as mumble-django exclusively uses DBus to connect to Murmur and does not
access Murmur's database directly.

Also note that this application requires Python 2.3 or later, and a
functional installation of Django 1.0 or newer. You can obtain Python
from http://www.python.org/ and Django from http://www.djangoproject.com/.
